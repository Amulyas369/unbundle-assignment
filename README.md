# Carousel (Image Slider):

## An array crouselImage is defined to store the data of images for the carousel.
#### The JavaScript code dynamically creates and appends image slides to the carousel container based on the data from crouselImage.
#### Event listeners for "Next" and "Previous" buttons are added to navigate through the carousel.
#### An automatic rotation of the carousel is implemented using setInterval.

# Adding Chocolates to a Custom Bundle:

#### An array chocolatescollections is defined to store data about different chocolates available for selection.
#### JavaScript code dynamically creates and appends chocolate items to the chocolate list based on the data from chocolatescollections.
#### Event listeners are added to the "Add To Bundle" buttons to allow users to select chocolates for their custom bundle.
#### The code tracks the selected chocolates, calculates the total price, and ensures that no more than 8 chocolates are selected.
#### A "Remove" button is added for each selected chocolate to allow users to remove chocolates from the bundle.

# Frameworks and Tools:

#### The code primarily uses vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to implement the required functionality, without the need for additional frameworks or libraries.

# Reasoning behind Choices:

#### Vanilla JavaScript is used to keep the code simple and lightweight for these specific tasks. It doesn't require the use of additional frameworks or libraries because the functionality can be achieved with core JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
#### HTML and CSS are used for structuring and styling the web page elements, respectively.
#### Event listeners are employed to handle user interactions, such as button clicks and carousel navigation.
